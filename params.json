{"name":"Shapeshiftbot","tagline":"Send Bitcoins easily from within the Ethereum network","body":"A simple Ethereum contract to transfer Ether to Bitcoin, via Ether transactions or from within other contracts.\r\n\r\nIt is using [Shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io/) for the actual exchange and [Oraclize.it](https://www.oraclize.it) from the HTTP communication from within Ethereum.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIt is really simple to use within a contract:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport \"shapeshiftbot.api.sol\"\r\ncontract Hello is usingShapeshift {\r\n  function Hello() {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function test(uint value, string bitcoinAddress) {\r\n    shapeshiftTransfer(value, \"btc\", bitcoinAddress);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to make this work, you need to put [shapeshiftbot.api.sol](https://github.com/axic/shapeshiftbot/blob/master/shapeshiftbot.api.sol) in the same directory as your contract. The other Solidity sources are not needed from this project.\r\n\r\nI will periodically publish a new contract based on the changes in this repository and update the lookup contract. Please make a pull request instead of publishing a lot of copies of this contract on Ethereum.\r\n\r\n## How does this actually works?\r\n\r\nFor more information please read the [README](https://github.com/axic/shapeshiftbot/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\nCreated by Alex Beregszaszi during a blockchain hackathon.
